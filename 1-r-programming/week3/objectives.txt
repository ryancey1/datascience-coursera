Week 3: Loop Functions and Debugging

This week is what I call "loop functions" in R, which are functions that allow you to execute loop-like behavior in a compact form. These functions typically have the word "apply" in them and are particularly convenient when you need to execute a loop on the command line when using R interactively. These functions are some of the more interesting functions of the R language. This week we also cover the debugger that comes with R and how to interpret its output to help you find problems in your programs and functions. The lecture videos for this week are:
-Loop functions: lapply, apply, tapply, split, mapply
-Debugger, Parts 1-3
-Learning Objectives

By the end of this week you should be able to:
-Define an anonymous function and describe its use in loop functions [see lapply]
-Describe how to start the R debugger for an arbitrary R function
-Describe what the traceback() function does and what is the function call stack
