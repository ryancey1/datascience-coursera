Week 4: Simulation & Profiling

This week covers how to simulate data in R, which serves as the basis for doing simulation studies. We also cover the profiler in R which lets you collect detailed information on how your R functions are running and to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed. The profiler is a key tool in helping you optimize your programs. Finally, we cover the str function, which I personally believe is the most useful function in R.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this week you should be able to:
-Call the str function on an arbitrary R object
-Describe the difference between the "by.self" and "by.total" output produced by the R -profiler
-Simulate a random normal variable with an arbitrary mean and standard deviation
-Simulate data from a normal linear model
